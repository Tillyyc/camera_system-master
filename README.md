# ECE 532 Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors 
## Project Overview
In the digital domain, hand gesture recognition plays a vital role in conveying diverse messages, facilitated by advancements in imaging technology and image processing algorithms. Real-time identification of hand gestures has become feasible, with applications extending into various domains, including gaming. Rock Paper Scissors is a timeless and universally recognised game, serving as a go-to choice for decision-making scenarios where fairness and unpredictability are key. This zero-sum game is characterized by hand gestures representing rock, paper, and scissors. 
Our design includes 5 parts: 
1. vga camera
2. hdmi ouput
3. image compressor and grayscaler
4. CNN accelerator module
5. rock paper scissor game logic v.s computer
